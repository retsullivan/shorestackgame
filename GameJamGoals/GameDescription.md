# Beach Builder - Game Description

## Overview
**Beach Builder** is a cute 8-bit browser game set on a rocky Pacific Northwest beach where adorable sea creatures build and balance stacks of rocks for fun. The game features a nostalgic 1990s video game aesthetic with a Pacific Northwest beach theme, using teal, purple, and sandy colors.

## Game Concept
Players help cute sea creatures create magnificent rock towers on the Pacific coast. When creatures successfully build a balanced stack, they climb to the top in celebration (animated). The core gameplay combines puzzle-solving with physics-based stacking mechanics.
